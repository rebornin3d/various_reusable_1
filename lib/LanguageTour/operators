Operators

Operators are instance methods with special names.
Dart allows you to define operators with the following names:

 < 	+ 	| 	>>>
 > 	/ 	^ 	[]
 <= 	~/ 	& 	[]=
 >= 	* 	<< 	~
 – 	% 	>> 	==


 Note: You may have noticed that some operators, like !=,
 aren’t in the list of names. That’s because they’re just
 syntactic sugar. For example, the expression
  e1 != e2 is syntactic sugar for !(e1 == e2).
